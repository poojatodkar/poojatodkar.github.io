            <p>
                From my experience of interviewing develepers, I was surprised to know how many developers have only
                a very limited or even no understanding of how the DNS process actually works. So just thought it
                might be useful to give a quick, high-level overview of the process that is followed when a DNS
                resolution request is made.
            </p>
            <p>
                Computers communicate with other devices using IP addresses to identify eachother on internet.
                Humans can't remember IPs, hence they use words like "google.com", "facebook.com", etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Domain Name System (DNS) brings the two together and gets you to your destination.
            </p>
            <h5>Resolver Server:</h5>
            <p>
                Resolver server is usually ISP (Internet Service Provider). All resolvers must know one thing where to
                locate the root server (knows where to locate .com TLD server i.e Top-Level Domain).
            </p>
            <h5>Root Server:</h5>
            <p> Root servers sit at the top of DNS hierarchy.</p>
            <img class="root-server" src="./assets/images/dns-root-server.png" alt="DNS Root Server" />
            <p>The co-ordination of most top-level domains belong to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
                Numbers (ICANN). The .com TLD was one of the first created in 1985, now the largest TLD on internet.</p>
            <p>ICANN recognizes the following types of TLDs:</p>
            <ul class="types-of-tlds">
                <li>
                    <p><b>Generic code TLDs:</b> Usually 3 or more letters TLDs like ".net", ".org", ".edu", etc</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Country code TLDs:</b> 2 letters ISO code like for Japan is ".jp", for Australia is ".au", etc
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Internationalized code TLDs:</b> TLDs written in native languages like ".ykp"</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Infrastructure TLDs:</b> There is only one TLD in this category, which is ".arpa". The
                        Internet Assigned Numbers Authority controls this TLD for the Internet Engineering Task Force
                        (IETF).</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This image provides a high-level overview of how DNS works:</p>
            <img class="root-server" src="./assets/images/dns-overview.png" alt="DNS Overview" />
            <h5>Step 1: Request information</h5>
            <p>
                <p>When you ask your computer to resolve a hostname by visiting <a href="https://poojatodkar.com">https://poojatodkar.com</a>, the first thing
                    your computer does is looks for the corresponding IP address in its local DNS cache, which stores
                    information that your computer has recently retrieved.</p>
                <p>If your computer doesn’t already know the answer, it needs to perform a DNS query to find out.</p>
            </p>
            <h5>Step 2: Ask the recursive DNS servers</h5>
            <p>If the information is not stored locally, computer then queries (contacts) the recursive DNS servers
                (resolvers) from your Internet Service Provider (ISP). These specialized computers perform a DNS query
                on your behalf. Resolvers have their own caches, and given that many of the ISP’s customers are using
                the same resolvers, there is a reasonable chance that popular domains will already
                be cached. If this is the case for our example, <em>poojatodkar.com</em>, the process usually ends here and the
                information is returned to the user.</p>
            <p>Just about every ISP runs their own resolvers, yet those aren’t necessarily what you could be using. Some
                companies and perhaps even technically sophisticated home users could run their own resolvers on site.
                Additionally, there are several very popular open resolvers available, including Google Public DNS,
                OpenDNS, etc.</p>
            <p>So, if recursive DNS server doesn’t know the answer, it then goes to ask root name servers</p>
            <h5>Step 3: Ask the root name servers</h5>
            <p>A name server is a computer that answers questions about domain names, such as IP addresses. These 13
                servers act as a kind of telephone switchboard for DNS. They don’t know the answer, but they can direct
                DNS queries to someone that knows where to find it.</p>
            <h5>Step 4: Ask the TLD name servers</h5>
            <p>The root name servers will look at the first part of our request, reading from right to left,
                <em>www.poojatodkar.com</em>, and in our case, direct our query to the top-level domain (TLD) name servers for
                .com.
                Each TLD, such as those for .com, .org, and .us, has its own set of name servers, which act like a
                receptionist for each TLD. These servers don’t have the information we need, but they can refer us
                directly to the servers that do have the information.</p>
            <h5>Step 5: Ask the authoritative DNS servers</h5>
            <p>The TLD name servers review the next part of our request, <em>www.poojatodkar.com</em>, and direct our query to
                the name servers responsible for this specific domain. These authoritative name servers are responsible
                for knowing all the information about a specific domain, which is stored in DNS records. There are many
                types of records, which each contain a different kind of information.</p>
            <p>In this example, we want to know the IP address for <em>www.poojatodkar.com</em>, so we ask the authoritative name
                server for the address record (A record).
            </p>
            <h5>Step 6: Retrieve the record</h5>
            <p>The recursive server retrieves the A record for <em>poojatodkar.com</em> from the authoritative name servers and
                stores the record in its local cache. If anyone else requests the host record for <em>poojatodkar.com</em>, the
                recursive server will already have the answer and will not need to go through the whole lookup process
                again. All records have an expiration date, so after a while, the recursive server will need to ask for
                a new copy of the record to make sure the information is not outdated.</p>
            <h5>Step 7: Receive the answer</h5>
            <p>Receiving the answer, recursive server returns the A record back to the computer. Your computer stores
                the record in its cache, reads the IP address from the record, then passes this information to the
                browser which then opens a connection to the webserver and receives the website.</p>
            <p>This entire process, from start to finish, takes only milliseconds to complete.</p>
